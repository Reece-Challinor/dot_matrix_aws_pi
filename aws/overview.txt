### **2. Detailed AWS Architecture Overview**

The AWS architecture is designed to manage and streamline the flow of data from multiple sources, process it securely, and provide it to the Raspberry Pi for printing. Below is a comprehensive overview of each AWS service used and its role in the solution.

#### **A. AWS Components**

1. **AWS Lambda Functions**
   - Fetch data from external APIs (e.g., weather, stock market, security alerts).
   - Process and clean the data, transforming it into a simplified JSON format.
   - Publish the JSON payload to AWS IoT Core for Raspberry Pi consumption.

2. **AWS IoT Core**
   - Acts as the communication bridge between AWS services and the Raspberry Pi.
   - Facilitates secure, bi-directional communication using MQTT protocol.
   - Raspberry Pi subscribes to topics like `intelligence-briefing/weather`, `intelligence-briefing/security`, etc.

3. **AWS CloudWatch**
   - Monitors Lambda functions for performance and error logging.
   - Creates alarms for unexpected behaviors or failures in any Lambda function.

4. **AWS Secrets Manager**
   - Manages sensitive information such as API keys for third-party services.
   - Accessible only by Lambda functions with the proper IAM roles to ensure security.

5. **AWS IAM Policies**
   - Each Lambda function has an attached IAM role that grants it least-privilege permissions.
   - Policies include access to Secrets Manager, IoT Core, and CloudWatch logging.

### **3. Raspberry Pi and Printing Workflow**

The Raspberry Pi is responsible for aggregating the data from AWS IoT Core, formatting it, and sending it to the printer. Below is a detailed description of each step:

#### **A. Physical Button Integration**

- The physical button is connected to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.
- **`button_listener.py`** script listens for button presses. Once detected, it triggers the entire workflow, starting with **`print_daemon.py`**.

#### **B. Data Aggregation and Processing**

1. **Data Fetching (`print_daemon.py`)**
   - Subscribes to AWS IoT Core topics using AWS IoT SDK (`boto3` and `AWSIoTPythonSDK`).
   - Receives data payloads from each topic (e.g., `intelligence-briefing/weather`, `intelligence-briefing/market`).

2. **Data Aggregation (`data_aggregator.py`)**
   - Aggregates data from multiple sources into a single JSON structure.
   - Handles error-checking and data validation, ensuring all necessary fields are available.

3. **Data Formatting (`data_formatter.py`)**
   - Formats the aggregated JSON data into the **`briefing_template.txt`**.
   - Uses ASCII headers, dividers, tables, and graphs to ensure the printed document follows the established design language.

#### **C. Printing**

- **`printer_interface.py`** uses CUPS to send formatted text to the dot matrix printer.
- Saves the formatted data as `/tmp/briefing.txt` before executing the print command (`lp /tmp/briefing.txt`).

### **4. Visual Representation of AWS Architecture**

Here’s a visual representation of the AWS architecture in ASCII format, followed by a detailed textual explanation:

```

+----------------------+       +--------------------+      +-------------------+
                                                         |
                                                         |

+----------------------+       +--------------------+      |
                                                         |
                     +-----------------------------------|
                     |
                     v
           +-------------------+       +-------------------+
           |  Raspberry Pi     |       |  Dot Matrix       |
           |  (Subscribe to    | ----> |  Printer          |
           |  AWS IoT Topics)  |       |  (Print Briefing) |
           +-------------------+       +-------------------+
```

**Explanation**:

1. **External APIs**: Data is pulled from various public and proprietary sources, such as OpenWeatherMap, MarineTraffic, FBI.gov, and Alpha Vantage.

2. **AWS Lambda**: Each Lambda function is dedicated to fetching data from one source, processing it, and publishing the cleaned and formatted data to relevant AWS IoT Core topics.

3. **AWS IoT Core**: Acts as the message broker that the Raspberry Pi subscribes to in order to gather information securely.

4. **AWS Secrets Manager**: Handles sensitive API keys to ensure they are not hardcoded within the Lambda functions. This guarantees a secure way to manage access to APIs.

5. **AWS CloudWatch**: Provides monitoring, alerting, and logging for Lambda functions, making it easier to debug and identify issues during the data-fetching phase.

6. **Raspberry Pi**: Connects to AWS IoT Core via MQTT to retrieve data from the specific topics (`intelligence-briefing/weather`, etc.). The data is then aggregated and formatted.

7. **Dot Matrix Printer**: The final report is formatted as per the template and sent to the dot matrix printer using CUPS.

### **5. Pre-Processing and Post-Processing Details**

#### **A. Pre-Processing**
- **Normalization**: Data normalization occurs within Lambda functions, ensuring uniform data types across sources (e.g., all temperatures converted to Fahrenheit).
- **Error Handling and Retries**: Lambda functions incorporate retry mechanisms to handle failed API calls.

#### **B. Post-Processing**
- **Data Integrity Checks**: Once data is received by the Raspberry Pi, it is validated to ensure all fields are populated, reducing the risk of incomplete briefings.
- **Logging**: Logs are generated for every step, from button press detection to successful printing, enabling a detailed audit trail.

### **6. Button-Triggered Workflow**

1. **Button Press Detection**:
   - The physical button is pressed, and **`button_listener.py`** triggers the **`print_daemon.py`** script.

2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - The Raspberry Pi subscribes to AWS IoT Core topics and fetches relevant data.

3. **Data Aggregation**:
   - The **`data_aggregator.py`** consolidates the data from all available topics.

4. **Formatting and Printing**:
   - **`data_formatter.py`** formats the data according to the predefined template.
   - The **`printer_interface.py`** sends the formatted file to the dot matrix printer.

### **7. Diagram Description and Conclusion**

The architecture has been designed to ensure a smooth flow from data gathering to printing, with each AWS service playing a critical role.

- **Serverless Design**: Using AWS Lambda ensures low cost and scalability, making this architecture efficient.
- **Security Focus**: The use of IAM policies and AWS Secrets Manager guarantees the secure handling of sensitive information.
- **Edge Processing**: The Raspberry Pi manages final formatting and printing, minimizing latency and making it responsive.

This MVP architecture provides a seamless way to generate comprehensive daily briefings with a retro-inspired dot matrix printout at the push of a button, leveraging modern cloud infrastructure for data processing while retaining a vintage delivery method.
